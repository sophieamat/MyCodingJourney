# MyCodingJourney
Keeping track of my coding journey.
Today I've started my 100 day challenge to learn Python. 

Met with my mentor today who recommends: ReadMe Markup - how to write formatted ReadMe files - bullet points, headings, bolded texts etc
OK it's 4:34 in Perth, WA and I've managed to clone one folder to my Desktop Github app, and also download the VS Code editor. The infrastrutcture essentials are done.

My coder friend Rene's tips today: 1) VS Code is good, but a fork called Cursor has really great AI assistance. It's same as visual studio code, but extended with AI
2) Don't be shy in using AI - really important when used for learning to speeds up brain processing. 3) ChatGTp4 with code interpreter is really good. 4) You can also try Claude (need Opera for VPN bypass). But many models getting out soon, that will be finetuned for coding.

Session notes:

* Set-up Github correctly. Why? GH is a powerful repo / activity tracker therefore upload all learning code + projects to show progress of learning / work over 100 days;

* Self-taught proficiency is a thing - learn &/or solve 1 small Python problem every day;

* If you miss a day, add $5 to your Python tithes jar - money is a motivator (& donate it to the She Codes Australia community for women);

* First project / learning task - Algorithms with assistance of an online course and ChatGPT

* Accept ChatGPT as a learning partner / assistant / tutor e.g. if I'm stuck, ask it to explain the concept, line of code as if I'm 5 years old .. lol!

* Python Loops are super important

* Code daily & commit code to GH - DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN

* If you attend blockchain, Web3, Crypto events (as a participant / public speaker / moderator etc) journal your attendances and the role you played

* NB: Everytime you update the MyCodingJournal it's a commit - that being said it's NOT coding so focus on learning code daily

* Cross reference to the Google Doc that Mitch created re the learning steps for the next week or so!

* Finally - configure MacBook with Github App + VS Code (editor) and clone your GitHub repo onto local drive :) Whew! That's it.
