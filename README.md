# MyCodingJourney
Keeping track of my coding journey
Today I've started my 100 day challenge to learn Python. 
Met with my mentor today who recommends: ReadMe Markup - how to write formatted ReadMe files - bullet points, headings, bolded texts etc
OK it's 4:34 in Perth, WA and I've managed to clone one folder to my Desktop Github app, and also download the VS Code editor. The infrastrutcture essentials are done.
My friend Rene also mentioned: VS Code is good, but a fork called Cursor has really great AI assistance. It's same as visual studio code, but extended with AI
