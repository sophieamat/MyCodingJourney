# MyCodingJourney
Keeping track of my coding journey
Today I've started my 100 day challenge to learn Python. 

Met with my mentor today who recommends: ReadMe Markup - how to write formatted ReadMe files - bullet points, headings, bolded texts etc
OK it's 4:34 in Perth, WA and I've managed to clone one folder to my Desktop Github app, and also download the VS Code editor. The infrastrutcture essentials are done.

My coder friend Rene's tips today: 1) VS Code is good, but a fork called Cursor has really great AI assistance. It's same as visual studio code, but extended with AI
2) Don't be shy in using AI - really important when used for learning to speeds up brain processing. 3) ChatGTp4 with code interpreter is really good. 4) You can also try Claude (need Opera for VPN bypass). But many models getting out soon, that will be finetuned for coding.
